Part of a GUI based application that allows for multiple users to chat seamlessly. This part contains the client side code. The client application connects to the remote server to report membership to the chat and then different threads for reading and writing allows for uninterrupted reading from/writing to the server. Also a simple XOR based end to end encryption system is implemented in the client side code.
